# Pytorch-on-Google-Cloud
In this repository are hosted the ML tutorial for the school organised by NIKHECS/ICTP/CHPC in Stellenbosch in 2023.



##Overview of the notebooks


- [01_intro.ipynb](05_Dask_overview.ipynb)
  : A brief introduction to Pytorch


- [02-Autograd.ipynb] (02-Autograd.ipynb)
  :Introduction to gradient computation in pytorch

- [03_sgd_training.ipynb] (03-sgd-training.ipynb )
  : Training Deep Learning with Stochastic Gradient Descent

- [04-optimizers.ipynb](04-optimizers.ipynb)
  : Focusing on an important aspect of DL model: optimizers


- [05_Dask_overview.ipynb](05_Dask_overview.ipynb)
  : A brief overview of the Dask API


- [06-images.ipynb](06-images.ipynb)
  : Let's take a look at how images are interpreted by computers. We need to understand this if we want to understand DL models


- [07-convnets.ipynb](07-convnets.ipynb)
  : tutorial on convolutional neural networks




- [08_getting_started_with_TPUs.ipynb](08_getting_started_with_TPUs.ipynb)
  :Learning about new technologies available on google cloud to train DL models
    
- [09_XLA_Resnet18_CIFAR_training.ipynb](09_XLA_Resnet18_CIFAR_training.ipynb)
  : Resnet stands for Residual networks, as stated on Wikipedia DL page the most cited DL architecture of the 21st century. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a very famous dataset in computer vision. This dataset contains 60, 000 32Ã—32 color images in 10 different classes (airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks), etc. 







There are excellent free resources to deepen your knowledge
on topics such as Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and more
in general Artificial Intelligence.

Here is a selection of very good ones.

- Neural network class (Hugo Larochelle)

  After almost 10 years still a very useful resource: crystal clear explanations
  of an impressive amount of topics, starting from the very basics (I used this
  a lot!)

- Information Theory, Pattern Recognition, and Neural Networks (Dave McKay)
  (See also the accompanying book)

  The Lectures of Dave MacKay will accompany you to the study of its beautiful book:
  on of the most precious resources you will find on this topic.
  
  Information theory is very relevant in many fields, and particularly in Unsupervised Deep Learning.
